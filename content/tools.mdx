    ## Feature Decision Navigator

    Walk through all 4 strategic quadrants for a single feature decision. Perfect for quick scoping calls and feature-level trade-off discussions.

    <FeatureDecisionNavigator />

    ### The 4 Quadrants

    | Quadrant | Question | Axes |
    |----------|----------|------|
    | **Build Decision** | Should we build it? | Importance × Data Quality |
    | **Prioritization** | When to build it? | Value × Effort |
    | **Delivery Approach** | How to build it? | Capacity × Data Quality |
    | **Support Model** | How to support it? | Risk × Capacity |

    See the [Quadrant Reference](/tools?tab=Quadrant+Reference) for detailed explanations of each quadrant.

    ## Task Classifier

    Classify any task into the 3D estimation cube (Layer × Scope × Priority) to determine investment level, billing model, and reusability.

    <TaskClassifier />

    ### How to Use

    1. **Enter a task description** — be specific about what you're building
    2. **Select the Layer** — is this Platform (backend) or Integration (frontend) work?
    3. **Select the Scope** — who can reuse this? Universal, Industry-specific, or Client-specific?
    4. **Select the Priority** — Essential (must have), Enhanced (improves quality), or Specialized (research/POC)?
    5. **Review results** — see investment justification, billing model, and recommendations

    This tool implements the [Estimation Framework](/estimation) dimensions.

    ## Story Level Assessor

    Determine if a task belongs to Essential (Tooling), Enhanced (Platform Spikes), or Specialized (Context Spikes) through guided questions.

    <StoryLevelAssessor />

    ### The Three Story Levels

    | Level | Name | Focus |
    |-------|------|-------|
    | **1** | Essential (Tooling) | Strategy-agnostic infrastructure that enables flexibility |
    | **2** | Enhanced (Platform Spikes) | Technology understanding that transfers to future clients |
    | **3** | Specialized (Context Spikes) | Industry or client-specific discovery and customization |

    Learn more about the philosophy in the [Estimation Framework](/estimation) → Story Levels tab.
