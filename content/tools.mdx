    ## Search Scope Generator

    Walk through a guided assessment to generate a complete implementation scope. This tool evaluates:

    - **Client context** — Industry, timeline, pain points
    - **Data readiness** — Catalog, behavioral, relationships, AI enrichment potential
    - **Client capacity** — Team ownership, technical level, review frequency

    The generator outputs:
    - Recommended features by implementation phase (Day 1 → Day 90)
    - Investment levels per feature (MVP, Standard, Polished, Premium)
    - Support tier recommendation
    - Risk flags and AI enrichment opportunities

    <Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
      Unlike traditional assessments, this tool recognizes that **AI enrichment can fill data gaps** — missing descriptions and attributes are no longer blockers if the client is open to AI-generated content with human review.
