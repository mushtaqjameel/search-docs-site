    ## Task Classifier

    Classify any task into the 3D estimation cube (Layer × Scope × Priority) to determine investment level, billing model, and reusability.

    <TaskClassifier />

    ### How to Use

    1. **Enter a task description** — be specific about what you're building
    2. **Select the Layer** — is this Platform (backend) or Integration (frontend) work?
    3. **Select the Scope** — who can reuse this? Universal, Industry-specific, or Client-specific?
    4. **Select the Priority** — Essential (must have), Enhanced (improves quality), or Specialized (research/POC)?
    5. **Review results** — see investment justification, billing model, and recommendations

    This tool implements the [Estimation Framework](/estimation) dimensions.

    ## Story Level Assessor

    Determine if a task belongs to Essential (Tooling), Enhanced (Platform Spikes), or Specialized (Context Spikes) through guided questions.

    <StoryLevelAssessor />

    ### The Three Story Levels

    | Level | Name | Focus |
    |-------|------|-------|
    | **1** | Essential (Tooling) | Strategy-agnostic infrastructure that enables flexibility |
    | **2** | Enhanced (Platform Spikes) | Technology understanding that transfers to future clients |
    | **3** | Specialized (Context Spikes) | Industry or client-specific discovery and customization |
